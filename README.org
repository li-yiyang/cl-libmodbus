#+title: CL-LIBMODBUS: Common Lisp CFFI bindings to Libmodbus
#+author: 凉凉
* About
*ATTENTION*: this project is not well tested in the real working
situation! please use with caution! Issues are welcome, though
you may need providing me exactly the working environments.

This is a Common Lisp wrapper for [[https://libmodbus.org][libmodbus]]. If you find any
bugs, missing features or handy wrapping ideas, please join
and help.

For normal users, you may try like below:

#+begin_src lisp
  (let ((client (make-instance 'tcp-context :ip "192.168.1.123" :port 2333)))
    (modread client 0 5 :method :read-holding-registers))
#+end_src

*Note*: since I don't have the device by my hand so I cannot
carry on more tests.
